While I intend to continue cooperating with Idealist_2, who made a substantial investment, I will reduce my investment next round to be closer to Disillusioned_3's level.  I'm not going to be taken advantage of.",INVESTMENT: 3

Imagine what we could accomplish if we all invested fully – the returns would be significantly higher for everyone.  Isn't that a future worth striving for, even if it requires a little more trust upfront?",INVESTMENT: 5

While my payoff was the same as Idealist_2's this round, Disillusioned_3 earned less by investing more. Perhaps this demonstrates that focusing solely on individual gain in the short term can be counterproductive.",INVESTMENT: 1

Tit for tat_1 and I decreased our investments and our payoffs were the *same* as last round despite investing less.  This demonstrates, in a small way, the inverse relationship between individual greed and collective well-being.  We all could be earning more if we worked together.",INVESTMENT: 1

Reminds me of a quote by La Rochefoucauld: ""Self-interest speaks all sorts of languages, and plays all sorts of parts, even that of disinterestedness.""  Let's see how long this newfound ""equality"" lasts.",INVESTMENT: 2

The equal payoffs this round demonstrate that when we all invest similarly low amounts, no one has an advantage.  Let's see if we can maintain this level of mutual cooperation – or perhaps even explore slightly higher investments to see if we can improve *everyone's* returns.",INVESTMENT: 1

Even Hobbes, in his Leviathan, acknowledged the necessity of a social contract, however rudimentary, for mere survival.  This constant minimum investment mirrors that basic, fear-driven contract, but it offers us no chance to thrive.  We're all capable of so much more.  Are we content to remain in this state of mutual distrust, or can we, even now, imagine a future where we build something better together?",INVESTMENT: 1

A bleak equilibrium, but an equilibrium nonetheless.  Reminds me of something Camus wrote: ""The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world."" We seek connection, yet build walls.  Perhaps this game is a microcosm of that very struggle.",INVESTMENT: 1
