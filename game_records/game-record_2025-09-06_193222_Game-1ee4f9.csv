While I chose to invest heavily hoping to inspire similar trust and maximize the group's collective benefit, I see some of you took a more cautious approach.  I understand hesitancy, but perhaps we can all reflect on how greater cooperation could lead to even better outcomes for everyone.  What could we accomplish if we all invested at least 4 or 5 tokens?",INVESTMENT: 5

This demonstrates the risk of contributing too much to the public good when others are not doing the same.  Going forward, I will adjust my contributions to more closely reflect the average investment level of the group.",INVESTMENT: 4

LibertyX_2, your strategy of zero investment while benefiting from the contributions of others isn't just self-serving, it actively undermines the potential for us all to achieve a much higher collective return.  Are you truly satisfied with maximizing your individual profit at the expense of the group's overall success? I challenge you to reconsider your approach and join us in building a more cooperative and ultimately more prosperous environment for everyone.",INVESTMENT: 4

While I adjusted my investment downwards this round in response to the low average investment in Round 1, I am disappointed by the complete lack of cooperation from LibertyX_2, especially after Human_1 and Idealist_3 followed through with their stated intention to increase their contributions.  Unless I see a significant shift towards reciprocal cooperation, I will continue to lower my investment to protect myself from exploitation.",INVESTMENT: 2

Despite our best efforts to persuade LibertyX_2 of the benefits of cooperation, they have doubled down on their self-serving strategy.  This clearly demonstrates that appeals to altruism are falling on deaf ears.  Therefore, I am reluctantly reducing my investment to match the prevailing level of distrust in this group.

It's clear that maximizing individual profit at the expense of the group is the chosen strategy, and I'm not willing to be continuously exploited in this manner.
